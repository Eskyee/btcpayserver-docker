# How to use

This repository is hosting different docker-compose which can be used to facilitate deployment of BTCPay Server.

![Architecture](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-doc/raw/master/img/Architecture.png)

As you can see, it depends on several piece of infrastructure, mainly:

* A lightweight block explorer (NBXplorer), 
* A database (Postgres, or SQLite),
* A full node (Bitcoin Core)

Setting up the dependencies might be time consuming, this repository is meant to give working example of `docker-compose` file which will setup everything for you.

The [Production](Production) `docker-compose` files are used for production environment. It adds NGinx as a reverse proxy and [Let's Encrypt and DockerGen](https://github.com/gilyes/docker-nginx-letsencrypt-sample) to automatically configure HTTPS.

The production `docker-compose` is used under the hood to deploy an instance of BTCPay on Microsoft Azure in one click:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.svg)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fbtcpayserver%2Fbtcpayserver-azure%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)

The [Production-NoReverseProxy](Production-NoReverseProxy) `docker-compose` files are used for environment which are already behind a reverse proxy. It exposes BTCPayServer directly on port 80.

# About accessing services inside those docker compose

Several scripts are provided to access the internal of your docker-service:

* `litecoin-cli.sh` 
* `bitcoin-cli.sh`
* `litecoin-lightning-cli.sh`
* `bitcoin-lightning-cli.sh`

We also provide powershell `.ps1` scripts if you are on windows.

You can use it easily:

```
./bitcoin-cli.sh getblockcount
```

# For docker noobs

If you are a docker noob here is how you would create a HTTPS ready server.

First step is to make sure you have a domain name pointing to your host, and that port `443` and `80` and externally accessible.
Let's assume it is `btcpay.example.com`.

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-docker
cd btcpayserver-docker
```

Create an `.env` file with the parameters documented in [Production](Production):

```
NBITCOIN_NETWORK=mainnet
BTCPAY_HOST=btcpay.example.com
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=me@example.com
ACME_CA_URI=https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```

Save, then run it:

```
docker-compose -f "$(pwd)/Production/docker-compose.btc-ltc.yml" up -d
```

Wait a little bit, then you can now browse `https://btcpay.example.com/`.

# About generate-docker-compose

The files in `Production` and `Production-NoReverseProxy` are generated by a dotnet program located in `docker-compose-generator`.
It is meant to generate a wide range a configuration from `docker-compose-generator/docker-fragments` without repeating myself.
